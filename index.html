    <p>
        <strong>Vietnam</strong> is a country rich in history and traditions, with equally
        stunning <strong>natural and cultural sites</strong>. It is home to eight UNESCO World
        Heritage Sites. <br />Landscape varies from pristine <strong>beaches</strong> to sky-high 
        <strong>limestone peaks</strong>, with all shades of <strong>green vegetation</strong> in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's more than 300,000 square kilometers wide, so you have to be
        strategic planning your itinerary around the country. Here is the
        very best that you don't want to miss.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 1</span> On the first day, you'll arrive at
            <a href="https://www.vietnamairport.vn/noibaiairport/en/">Hanoi airport</a>. Get some rest and start adjusting to the time zone.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 2 & 3</span> On the second and third day,
            book a cruise to Ha Long Bay. You'll be able to kayak into beautiful
            caves and visit the fishermen's villages.
            An agency like <a href="https://lilystravelagency.com/">Lily's</a> can help you organize.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 4</span> Hop on a train to Hue - better if
                overnight!
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 5</span> Take your time around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%E1%BA%BF">Hue</a>.
                It was the old imperial city and preserved its Imperial Citadel as well as
                the Forbidden Purple City, once home to the imperor.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 6</span> Travel from Hue to Hoi An via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang">Danang</a>.
                Danang is a more modern city, perfect if you'd like to stop 
                for some shopping and fine eating.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 7</span> Visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BB%99i_An#cite_note-21">Hoi An</a>.
                Another city filled with
                history, Hoi An was a trading port and blended foreing influences into 
                its traditional buildings and canals. Enjoy a romantic dinner, and 
                don't miss the Full Moon Festival! 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 8</span> Go back to Danang, then travel to Bai
                Xep via Quy Nhon. Bai Xep is a small coastal village, where the beach
                is beautiful and you can get to meet the locals and eat some excellent
                fresh fish. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 9</span> Head back to Quy Nhon to catch 
                your transportation to Ho Chi Minh City. It's going to be a few hours 
                on the road, so sit back and relax.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 10 & 11</span> Visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>,
                or Saigon. It's now Vietnam's largest city, and it combines historic landmarks with
                modern buildings and an economy in rapid expansion. Visit some of the 
                museums and don't miss the Reunification Palace.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 12</span> Head to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BA%A7n_Th%C6%A1">Can Tho</a>,
                on the Mekong delta. Its canals populated with floating markets are the perfect venue
                for shopping like the locals.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 13</span> Back to Ho Chi Minh City, take a domestic
                flight to Hanoi. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class = "day">Day 14</span> For your last day, spend some time
                visiting Hanoi's Old Quarter and French Quarter. Time to say
                goodbye!
